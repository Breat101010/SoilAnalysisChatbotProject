COMMON CROPS GROWN IN ZIMBABWE
---

Zimbabwe's economy heavily relies on agriculture, with almost half the country's exports derived from this sector. A wide range of crops are grown, suitable for various farming regions and scales (smallholder to large-scale commercial).

**Major Staple and Commercial Crops:**
* **Maize (Corn):** The country's staple crop, accounting for a substantial proportion of fertilizer applied. Widely grown by communal farmers, crucial for food security and income.
* **Tobacco:** A major commercial crop and significant export. Flue-cured tobacco is a key variety.
* **Cotton:** Important commercial crop, widely produced in both communal and commercial lands, though production has shifted significantly towards communal areas.
* **Soybeans:** Grown for commercial purposes, requires fertile soil and often inoculants.
* **Wheat:** Primarily grown in the winter cropping season, often under irrigation.
* **Horticultural Crops:** Include roses, cut flowers, and various vegetables (e.g., cabbage, onions, tomatoes, rape).
* **Sugarcane:** Primarily grown in Natural Region V, often under irrigation.

**Other Significant Crops:**
* **Millet (Pearl Millet, Finger Millet):** Drought-tolerant small grains, increasingly adopted, especially in drier regions.
* **Sorghum:** Another drought-tolerant small grain, important for food security, particularly red sorghum varieties suitable for hot, dry climates.
* **Groundnuts (Peanuts):** N-fixing crop, often produced by small-scale farmers in communal areas.
* **Beans/Cowpeas (Nyemba):** Important legumes, often considered "women's crops" in communal areas.
* **Barley:** Grown, often in winter.
* **Sunflower:** Oilseed crop, boron is essential for its growth.
* **Potatoes:** Common tuber crop.
* **Fruit Trees:** Mango and citrus are promoted as climate-resilient options.
* **Sesame:** Efforts are being made to improve access to quality sesame seed, focusing on drought and heat tolerance.
* **Coffee & Tea:** Plantation crops in specific frost-free areas (Eastern Highlands).
* **Macadamia Nuts:** Also grown in the Eastern Highlands.

**Key Trends:**
* Increasing adoption of drought-tolerant crops due to climate change.
* Shift towards more market-oriented farming systems, especially through innovation platforms.
* Importance of both staple crops for food security and cash crops for income generation.
