AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES IN ZIMBABWE
---

Zimbabwe's agricultural sector is adapting to various challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and input costs. Both traditional and modern practices are in use, with a growing emphasis on climate-smart agriculture.

**Agricultural Calendar:**
* **November to March:** Main cropping season (summer).
* **April to July:** Harvesting period for summer crops.
* **May to September:** Winter cropping season.
* **August to October:** Land preparation for summer crops.

**Key Farming Practices:**

1.  **Conservation Agriculture (CA):**
    * **Minimum or Nil Soil Disturbance:** Reduces erosion and moisture loss. Farmers use basin tillage (digging basins to capture water and nutrients) or ox-pulled rippers for small furrows.
    * **Soil Cover Maintenance:** Retention of previous year's crop residues (mulch) instead of burning, which preserves moisture and enriches the soil.
    * **Crop Rotation and Intercropping:** Mixing and rotating crops (e.g., maize with legumes) to improve soil fertility and spread risk.
    * **Benefits:** Improves soil health, moisture retention, and resilience, leading to more successful yields compared to conventional methods. Adoption is growing, particularly in semi-arid areas.

2.  **Water Conservation Techniques:**
    * Efficient irrigation systems (drip irrigation).
    * Rainwater harvesting.
    * Contour ridges and stormwater diversion channels.
    * Emphasis on early planting with the first rains.

3.  **Soil Management:**
    * **Regular Soil Testing:** Essential for understanding nutrient status and making informed fertilization choices.
    * **Appropriate Fertilization:** Application of both organic (manure, compost, leaf litter) and inorganic fertilizers.
    * **Liming:** Crucial for correcting soil acidity, especially in sandy soils.
    * **Organic Amendments:** Use of cattle manure, Bokashi, Atlas orgfert, Orgfert, Vermicompost to restore soil health, structure, and microbial activity.

4.  **Crop and Seed Management:**
    * **Drought-Tolerant Crop Varieties:** Increasing adoption of sorghum, pearl millet, sesame, and sweet potato varieties.
    * **Participatory Varietal Selection (PVS):** Farmers are involved in selecting and multiplying their own seeds, boosting ownership and reducing dependence on external sources.
    * **Crop Diversification:** Growing a variety of crops to spread risk and improve soil fertility.

5.  **Pest Management:**
    * **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combining biological, cultural (adjusting planting times, crop rotation, field sanitation), and judicious chemical control methods.

6.  **Mechanization:**
    * Promoting mechanized planting and processing methods, especially for crops like red sorghum, to reduce labor and increase productivity.

7.  **Agroforestry:**
    * Integrating trees and shrubs into crop and animal farming systems.

**Challenges Affecting Practices:**
* Frequent droughts and dry spells.
* Shortage of farming equipment and inputs.
* Lack of skills and poor funding.
* Declining livestock populations affecting manure availability.
* High cost of mineral fertilizers.
* Termite infestation in some areas.
* Land tenure systems and regulations.
